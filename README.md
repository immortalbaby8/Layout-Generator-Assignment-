## 📋 Features

* **Procedural Generation:** Generates random layouts of **Type A** (30x20m) and **Type B** (20x20m) buildings.
* **Constraint Logic:**
    * **Overlap Detection:** Ensures buildings do not overlap with each other or the central Plaza.
    * **Proximity Rules:** Enforces "Rule 4" (Type A buildings must be within 60m of a Type B building).
* **Evolutionary Learning:**
    * **Mutation:** Uses previously successful layouts ("parents") to generate new variations.
    * **Negative Reinforcement:** Tracks "Bad Spots" (coordinates where placement frequently fails) to optimize future generation speeds.
* **Blueprint Visualization:** Uses `Matplotlib` to render professional-grade architectural diagrams with dimension lines, gap measurements, and error indicators.
* **Interactive GUI:**
    * Infinite panning and zooming canvas.
    * Searchable batch history.
    * Right-click context menu to save high-resolution blueprint images.

## ⚙️ Deployment & Installation

### Prerequisites
1.  **Install Python:** Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib pillow
    ```
    *(Note: `tkinter` is usually included with standard Python installations. Linux users may need to install `python3-tk` separately).*

### Performance Note
**This application was developed and tested on a personal computer where it runs smoothly. However, the code has not yet been fully optimized.** As the "Infinite Canvas" and the layout generation algorithm (which involves heavy iterative constraint checking) can be resource-intensive, performance may vary on systems with lower specifications.

**Test System Configuration:**
The application was verified to run without issues on the following hardware:
* **Processor:** AMD Ryzen 9
* **Memory:** 32 GB RAM
* **Storage:** 1 TB SSD

## 🚀 Usage

1.  **Launch the App:** Run `main.py`. The application will immediately generate the first batch of 4 layouts.
2.  **Generate New:** Click the **GENERATE NEW** button in the top toolbar to create a new batch. The system attempts to create valid layouts; if a layout fails constraints, it is marked as `INVALID` in red.
3.  **Navigation:**
    * **Pan:** Click and drag anywhere on the canvas.
    * **Zoom:** Use the Mouse Wheel (or trackpad scroll) to zoom in and out.
4.  **Saving Images:**
    * Select a batch from the sidebar list.
    * Right-click on the list item and select **"Save as Image..."** to export the high-res PNG.
5.  **Data Persistence:** The app automatically creates a `data/` directory to store JSON logs of correct and failed attempts, which allows the algorithm to "learn" over time.
